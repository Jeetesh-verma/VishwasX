## 🔐 SecureApply Integration Blueprint

careerReboot AI is now organized to support a SecureApply-first architecture:

1. Company Trust System
	- Verify companies through phishing score logic
	- Trust gate: only companies with score `>= 85` are marked verified

2. User Identity System
	- Register users through phone OTP
	- Block duplicate accounts for the same phone number

3. Resume Security + Intelligence System
	- Upload resumes securely
	- Encrypt resumes and generate user-owned access keys
	- Analyze resumes to recommend roles, verified companies, and skill improvements

4. Career Experience Layer
	- Reuse existing dashboard, roadmap, mentorship, and community features
	- Surface trusted-company recommendations and secure apply actions in UI

- `docs/phases/implementation-phases.md`
